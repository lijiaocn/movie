剧情介绍：In spite of his best efforts, Jack Harriman (Burke) is a leader of men. Starting from a young age, Jack was whisked around the globe by his mother in search of 'enlightenment' and the next big thing in religion at that time. Due to his upbringing Jack has figured out that his extensive knowledge of religion and spirituality coupled with his amazing knack for humor and charm has allowed him to sway the opinions of men and lure the affections of the ladies. Realizing his best friends 'gifts' local TV station owner and producer Bob McCord asks Jack to help him out and co-host a local access cable TV show, "Divine Access". Although reluctant at first, Jack realizes it as a forum to discredit the spiritual phonies he sees each week on the program, and therefore welcomes the opportunity to put to task the intolerant, narrow-minded regular host, the Reverend Guy-Roy. After highly successful ratings of the show in which Jack was able to deliver his message (or non-message as he sees it) Bob encourages Jack to take the show on the road as his alone, leaving the irreverent Reverend Guy-Roy out of luck and out of a job. Reluctance again befalls Jack as he fears becoming exactly the kind of 'spiritual leader' he was raised resenting. With further sway from Bob and a visit from the mysterious Miriam who knows Jack's true heart, he decides to hit the road with the show. With his new career now moving forward "flock" and all Jack is a hit on his show's tour, while back at home Guy Roy's life is spiraling out of control.
