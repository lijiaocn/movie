## 《电影明星大乱斗》在线观看和高清下载-10858

剧情介绍：　　While not surpassing the original show, the movie was pretty decent. Dave Jesser and Matt Silverstein are great comedic writers and still managed to put together a solid reminder of what Drawn Together once was. There were still plenty of good jokes written from each characters perspective. The animation was almost where it was during the television series. Xander in general as a character seemed to be a bit off, i don't know what the deal was there. I hope this is a beginning to the show getting a re-hash for at least one season. I had also hoped there would be more 10 per center jokes (jokes that only 10% of the people off the street who watch the show understand) but maybe this was them trying to branch out and get a larger audience to possibly rent or buy the film.  　　All and all I give this film a 7/10. It's not for everyone and never will be... but if you have a sense of a humor and aren't afraid to laugh at what many would consider morally repulsive then you will think watching this was worth your time.  　　If anything, you'll be impressed by Hero's new fine-ass lady friend.

剧情介绍：The main character, Helmi, is born into the house of Baron von Strandmann in Old-Town Tallinn, in 1908. The only thing that she knows for sure about her past is that her mother was an Estonian servant girl. Everything else is a discovery during a life that runs the course of a century - a life that has quite a lot of surprises in store for Helmi. In this house she finds happiness and suffering, passion and disappointment. She grows up alongside young Erik and waits for her big love to blossom. But one floor down lives projectionist Julius - a man who is far from indifferent when it comes to Helmi. All of the biggest historical events of the century leave their mark on the house. Its hardwood floors have born soldiers' gruff boots and gentleman's shiny oxfords. Its walls have held the fates of people from far and near, foreigners and locals. Helmi's home becomes a German salon, a revolution museum, and a working class commune. And as freedom comes, real estate crooks start sniffing around the place. The only things that remain unchanged in these turbulent times are the cinema hall projecting living images on the screen and Julius's quiet love for Helmi. Director Hardi Volmer's historical love story combines the grotesque of early silent films with the melodrama of the golden age of cinema with elements of both the epic and the comic
