剧情介绍：　　A detective teams with a tabloid psychic to track down a missing child.  　　Detective John Koski (Jon Voight) is on the trail of a missing girl. The Chief Of Police's granddaughter has been kidnapped and time is running out to save her. In desperation Koski teams up with a television psychic who has had visions of the girl.  　　Academy Award winner Jon Voight (Ali, Deliverance, Midnight Cowboy) stars in this chilling supernatural thriller as John Koski, a detective on a mission to find the kidnapped niece of the Chief of Police. The straight laced Koski is reluctantly paired up to solve the case with Farley, a famous psychic claiming to have had visions of Amy. The investigation grows stranger as they get deeper into it, revealing a troubled family and their haunted house. Koski begins to question his sanity and is forced to confront a dark secret of his own.  　　Beyond has its moments. I liked the way it ended even if the twist was signposted earlier in the film. Voight puts in an honest performance in a plot that could have done with more emphasis on the characters backgrounds to give the audience time to empathise with the characters. If you want a thriller that isn’t challenging but is fairly safe, than Beyond is ideal. It’s no better or worse than many Police shows on TV right now. It’s well made but didn’t have enough substance or depth to keep me interested.  　　Low-budget paranormal thriller starring Jon Voight as a detective trying to track down a missing girl. When Amy (Chloe Lesslie), the daughter of the local police chief, goes missing, seen-it-all-before detective John Koski (Voight) is assigned the case. None too impressed when he's made to work alongside psychic investigator Farley (Teri Polo), who claims to have had visions of the missing girl, Koski's views rapidly change as the pair uncover increasingly sinister evidence that tests their beliefs to the core.
