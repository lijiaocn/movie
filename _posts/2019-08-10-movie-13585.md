剧情介绍：Elle (Ashlee Hewitt) wants to be a singer/songwriter, but her dreams are cut short by the sudden death of her parents. She moves in with her adoptive uncle, who runs a small independent record label whose biggest act, Sensation, is also Elle's biggest pain. The pop music environment at the label, very different than the country roots she is used to, adds to Elle's feelings of loss and frustration, and her misplaced guilt, which is caused by the fact that her parents had been en route to her performance at the time of their death. But when she meets Ty Parker (Sterling Knight), a famous pop singer with a passion for "real" music, her repressed ambition is released through a revitalized interest in singing and songwriting ...

剧情介绍：　　'Who is Alice' carries us on a darkly funny, compelling and sometimes cringe worthy journey into the highs and lows of what human beings will do to try to avoid pain and connect to happiness. Alice is a 35 year old actress desperately hanging on to her 'new young thing' career. She is willing to sacrifice almost everything in order to reach the top and this mind-bending story takes us down the rabbit hole with her. Alice meets Dick, a car salesman who is disillusioned with life and dreaming about becoming a spiritual teacher. Together with a renegade cast of misfit characters they hilariously and awkwardly tie themselves in knots as they find their 'way'. And where does that 'way' lead them? ... To exactly where they are supposed to be. 'Who is Alice' uses humor guided by the a little non-dual thinking to help us look at ourselves and life in a different way. If the insight strikes, your whole perspective can change, while 'in reality' nothing has to change. Written by Paul Smit
